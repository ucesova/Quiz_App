# Mobile Quiz App

The Mobile Quiz App is one part of a Location Based Quiz project. It shows questions to the user related with his/her location and works together with a web application where these questions are defined (called [Question setting app](https://github.com/ucesova/question_setting_app )). Additionally, both parts are served by an [HTTP node.js server](https://github.com/ucesova/Server).

Go to the [server readme](https://github.com/ucesova/Server/blob/master/README.md) to see further details.
